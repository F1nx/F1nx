# Heyo! Welcome to my lair.

I have grown up with computers and gotten to know them and the wonders they bring about. I had a spark of interest in cybersecurity because, being adventurous, I wanted to explore the mysterious deep web, which brought me down a rabbit trail, beginning with internet security. To this day, I am a big privacy advocate and I proudly support peer-to-peer technologies taking place of our centralized web.

Also, here's a way for you to get to know what I'm up to based on my GitHub profile:
* Repositories: *Ideas I have to benefit from, but may use some help with developing.*
* Forks: *I want to contribute, then delete my branch after doing so.*
* Stars: *Software I plan to use on a practical basis. Repos will be unstarred if they become irrelevant.*
  * Topics: *Subjects that I am quite interested in learning about or currently exploring.*
* Projects: *Things I may be working on. Could be stale.*

If you would like to contact me and I have given you my information, my public key is avaliable [on this repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fr33roam3r/fr33roam3r/master/publickey.asc).
