# Heyo! Welcome to my lair.

Here's a way for you to get to know what I'm up to based on my GitHub profile:
* Repositories: *Ideas I have to benefit from, but may use some help with developing.*
* Forks: *I want to contribute or have a copy of it for personal modification.*
* Stars: *Software I plan to use on a practical basis.*
  * Topics: *Subjects that I am quite interested in learning about or currently exploring.*
* Projects: *Things I may be working on long-term.*

If you would like to contact me and I have given you my information, my public key is avaliable [on this repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fr33roam3r/fr33roam3r/master/publickey.asc).
